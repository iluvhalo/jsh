Hold me tight
Love me right
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
What's the matter with you
Why must I tell you what to do
i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
It's a dangerous place
